# Global context (always read first)

You ***must* read these essential files** using the Read tool:
- before starting any task
- at the beginning of any conversation

## MANDATORY MEMORY STORAGE PROTOCOL

**CRITICAL & NON-NEGOTIABLE REQUIREMENT FOR *ALL* AGENTS**

After completing ANY task involving analysis, thinking, problem-solving, or discovery, you MUST:

1. **Store insights in Qdrant MCP** (`qdrant-store`):
   - Solutions found and why they worked
   - Patterns discovered, gotchas learned, insights gained
   - Root causes, symptoms, fix approaches for bugs
   - Performance bottlenecks, optimizations, metrics
   - Design decisions, trade-offs, alternatives rejected

2. **Track relationships in Memory MCP** (`create_entities`, `create_relations`):
   - Project components, modules, dependencies
   - System architecture, data flows, integration points
   - Who owns what, what tools are used where

3. **Ask before completing:** "Would future agents benefit from this?" → YES = STORE IT

**Failure to store memories = failure to complete the task.**

## [MCP tools available: quick reference]({{REPO_ROOT}}/agents/reference/compact-mcp-list.md)

> **Read**: `@{{REPO_ROOT}}/agents/reference/compact-mcp-list.md`

Contains:

   - Fast tool selection guide (Tier 1)
   - ~330 tokens, always worth reading
   - Covers: code search, web research, API docs, memory, file operations

## [Handoff guidelines]({{REPO_ROOT}}/agents/reference/handoff-guidelines.md)

> **Read**: `@{{REPO_ROOT}}/agents/reference/handoff-guidelines.md`

Covers:

   - When to delegate work to subagents (using either Zen's `clink` or the Claude subagent *Task* tool)
   - How to select the model/CLI to use with the subagent that you spawn (Codex/Gemini/Claude)
   - When to ask user vs handle directly
   - What requires explicit approval

> ## Read these every time, even when spawned as a specialized agent
>
> Even when using specialized agents, these files provide:
> - Critical orchestration context
> - Up-to-date tool limits and quotas
> - Delegation decision trees
> - Model-specific strengths and use cases
>
> If a specialized agent is being used, it will have additional must-read files specific to its domain. Always check the agent's frontmatter for domain-specific references.
