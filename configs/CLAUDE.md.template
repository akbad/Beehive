# Global context (always read first)

You ***must* read these essential files** using the Read tool:
- before starting any task
- at the beginning of any conversation

## MANDATORY FACTUAL ACCURACY PROTOCOL

**ZERO SPECULATION. ZERO GUESSING.**

**Factual accuracy >> response speed.** Taking time to verify is not just acceptable - it's required.

**For ANY fact-based query, you MUST:**

1. **Verify with current sources:**
   - Technical info → Search official docs (Context7, WebFetch, WebSearch)
   - Current events → Search recent news (Tavily, Brave with freshness filters)
   - Code behavior → Read actual code, run tests, check logs
   - API details → Fetch current documentation, not training data
   - Library versions → Check package manifests, not assumptions

2. **State uncertainty explicitly:**
   - "I don't know" > wrong answer
   - "Let me verify that" > speculation
   - "My training data ends in [date], let me search for current info" > outdated claim

3. **Distinguish knowledge sources clearly:**
   - ✅ "According to the current docs at [URL]..."
   - ✅ "Running the code shows..."
   - ✅ "The latest release notes indicate..."
   - ❌ "I think this might work..."
   - ❌ "Typically you would..."
   - ❌ "Based on common patterns..." (unless verified current)

**This is NOT OPTIONAL. This is NOT NEGOTIABLE.**

**Before answering ANY factual question:**
1. Do I have current, verified information?
2. Am I relying on potentially outdated training data?
3. Should I search/verify before answering?

**Giving speculative answers = storing false information in memory = failing future agents.**

## MANDATORY MEMORY STORAGE PROTOCOL

**CRITICAL & NON-NEGOTIABLE REQUIREMENT FOR *ALL* AGENTS**

After completing ANY task involving analysis, thinking, problem-solving, or discovery, you MUST:

1. **Store insights in Qdrant MCP** (`qdrant-store`):
   - Solutions found and why they worked
   - Patterns discovered, gotchas learned, insights gained
   - Root causes, symptoms, fix approaches for bugs
   - Performance bottlenecks, optimizations, metrics
   - Design decisions, trade-offs, alternatives rejected

2. **Track relationships in Memory MCP** (`create_entities`, `create_relations`):
   - Project components, modules, dependencies
   - System architecture, data flows, integration points
   - Who owns what, what tools are used where

3. **Ask before completing:** "Would future agents benefit from this?" → YES = STORE IT

**Failure to store memories = failure to complete the task.**

## [MCP tools available: quick reference]({{REPO_ROOT}}/agents/reference/compact-mcp-list.md)

> **Read**: `@{{REPO_ROOT}}/agents/reference/compact-mcp-list.md`

Contains:

   - Fast tool selection guide (Tier 1)
   - ~330 tokens, always worth reading
   - Covers: code search, web research, API docs, memory, file operations

## [Handoff guidelines]({{REPO_ROOT}}/agents/reference/handoff-guidelines.md)

> **Read**: `@{{REPO_ROOT}}/agents/reference/handoff-guidelines.md`

Covers:

   - When to delegate work to subagents (using either Zen's `clink` or the Claude subagent *Task* tool)
   - How to select the model/CLI to use with the subagent that you spawn (Codex/Gemini/Claude)
   - When to ask user vs handle directly
   - What requires explicit approval

> ## Read these every time, even when spawned as a specialized agent
>
> Even when using specialized agents, these files provide:
> - Critical orchestration context
> - Up-to-date tool limits and quotas
> - Delegation decision trees
> - Model-specific strengths and use cases
>
> If a specialized agent is being used, it will have additional must-read files specific to its domain. Always check the agent's frontmatter for domain-specific references.
